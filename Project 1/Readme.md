In this folder the project pictures and R files were uploaded <br>

1: Global power active histogram<br>
2: Global active power per day (in this case the x label has different names deu to my system configuration - spanish)<br>
3: Lines plot that shows the metering type (1,2, or 3) and their energy value<br>
4: A subplot (4 x 4) that shows plot 2, 3, the voltage vs day and the reactive power instead of active power<br><br>


Note that all of the plots were filtered by date between 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-03 (year - month - day)
